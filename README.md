# Project2_EC530

This repository contains the general functionality in which the program will interpret a JSON file and determine whether the input is in the correct format. Following this, the program will produce a JSON file in return. 

The minimum required are the fields: "Name" and "Age". Each module will specify what it is required for the program to correctly parse the information. 



# Administrative (Admin) Module:

The implementation of the admin module will involve three fields required for validation: Date of birth (DOB), Name, and Age. The goal with the admin module is to correctly load the specified administrative data (in the form of a JSON format for testing purposes), validate that it is in the correct format, and then store the information for retrieval inside MongoDB.
